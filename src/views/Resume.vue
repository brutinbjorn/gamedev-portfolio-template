    <h1>Resume</h1>

    <div class="paragraph">

      I'm <strong>Brutin Bjorn</strong>, A Graduated Bachelor student from the HOWEST University of Applied Sciences, <br/>
      Where i studied As a Game Developer, in the Ditigal Arts and Entertaiment mayor. <br/>
      Before I studied at DAE, I also studied At Vives, where got a Associates Degree in IT & Programming. <br/>
      The reason i wanted to study at DAE, after my studies at the Vives, is that I wanted to learn more advanced techniques when developing software. <br/>

      After my internship at THE PACK Brussels, I was able to work there for a additional 5 month's. <br/>

      Now I'm looking for a job where I can apply my skills i learned, and expand my knowledge as a Programmer/IT specialist. <br/>
       
      Besides my interest in Progrmming and video games, I also enjoy music, play a bit of guitar, love festivals and comedy events, I'm a news-junky and love movies.
      <!--, a former Delta Force operative with lots of experience, lots of training and huge muscles.
      <br />After graduating from kindergarten, I've been enrolled in the army for 25 years, where I learned to destroy things in an amazing number of ways.
      <br />I joined the Delta Force because I thought it was Greek lessons, but I quickly adapted to this unexpected environment and became a key element.
      <br />I love teamwork, but I can also go in solo depending on the mission requirements.
      <br />
      <br />Right now I'm trying to find inner peace after I've read some personal development books. I'm looking for a monk job so if you have any opportunity feel free to

      <br />Besides war, I'm passionate about firearms, martial arts, explosions, push-ups and flowers.-->
